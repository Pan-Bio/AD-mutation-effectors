For Deep-SMCI and Deep-CMCI models, please refer to https://zenodo.org/record/7102185#.YyuuT3bMKPo.
The complete processed datasets are available if the requesters are approved by Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: ADNI.
We also provide example datasets in the above link.
To run Deep-SMCI and Deep-CMCI, please format your input files such as mutations matrix or co-mutations matrix like the example datasets we provide in the Zenodo link.

Here is the demo for running Deep-SMCI and Deep-CMCI:
```
For Deep-SMCI:
Python Predict.py Deep-SMCI.h5 example_mutation.txt AD-score.txt

For Deep-CMCI:
Python Predict.py Deep-CMCI.h5 example_co_mutations.txt AD-score.txt
```
To note, AD-score is the prediction output file

Here is the demo for model optimization and evaluation:
```
For example,
For optimizing GRU with four layers for AD-score prediction based on mutation profiles:
Python GRU-4.py complete_mutation.txt complete_label.txt optimization_width optimization_depth seed >output1.txt 2>output1.sh.e

For optimizing LSTM with three layers for AD-score prediction based on co-mutation profiles:
Python LSTM-3.py complete_co-mutation.txt complete_label.txt optimization_width optimization_depth seed >output1.txt 2>output1.sh.e

For optimizing FCN with five layers for AD-score prediction based on co-mutation profiles:
Python FCN-5.py complete_co-mutation.txt complete_label.txt optimization_width optimization_depth seed >output1.txt 2>output1.sh.e

```
